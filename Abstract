This project utilizes the fetch_california_housing dataset to develop a machine learning model for predicting median house prices in California. Key features such as median income, average number of rooms, population, and geographic coordinates were selected for analysis. The data was split into training and testing sets, standardized for consistent scaling, and modeled using Linear Regression. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE and R² score, achieving an R² of approximately 0.60. Visualizations were included to compare actual vs predicted values. The study demonstrates that linear regression can provide moderate accuracy, with potential for improvement through feature expansion, advanced algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning.
