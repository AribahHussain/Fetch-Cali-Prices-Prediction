California Housing Price Prediction 
1. Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict median house values in California using features such as median income, average number of rooms, population, and geographic location. This project uses the fetch_california_housing dataset provided by Scikit-learn.

2. Dataset Overview
Source: sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing

Number of Instances: 20,640

Number of Features: 8 numerical predictors + 1 target variable (MedHouseVal)

Target Variable: Median house value (in hundreds of thousands USD)

Selected Features for Model:

MedInc: Median income in the block group

AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household

Population: Block group population

Latitude: Geographic coordinate (North–South)

Longitude: Geographic coordinate (East–West)

3. Data Preparation
Loading the Dataset – Used fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True) to load data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Feature Selection – Chose relevant features to balance accuracy and model simplicity.

Data Splitting – Divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Scaling – Standardized features using StandardScaler to ensure better model performance.

4. Model Development
Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

Reason for Choice: Interpretable, quick to train, and effective for continuous numerical targets.

5. Training & Prediction
Trained the model on scaled training data.

Generated predictions for the test set.

6. Model Evaluation
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared difference between predictions and actual values.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Shows error magnitude in the same unit as the target variable.

R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target explained by the model.

Sample Results:

RMSE: ~0.72

R²: ~0.60

7. Visualization
Scatter Plot: Displays actual vs predicted house prices, with a diagonal reference line for perfect predictions.

Data Display: Shows top predicted vs actual values for inspection.

8. Conclusion
The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of ~0.60, meaning it explains around 60% of the variance in California house prices based on selected features. While results are decent, accuracy can be improved using more complex models such as RandomForestRegressor, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.

9. Future Improvements
Add all 8 features from the dataset.

Use feature importance ranking for selection.

Implement ensemble models for higher accuracy.

Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
